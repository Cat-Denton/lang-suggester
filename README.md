#### By _**Cat Denton**_

## Technologies Used

* gitHub
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* javaScript
* jquery-3.5.1
* Visual Studio Code

## Description

_This webpage takes information submitted by a user and uses a script to tell the user what programming language they should learn. In the current build only the favorite pet and astrological sign has an outcome on which language is selected. When the user hits the submit button the form disappears and their answer appears. The questions and answers are designed to be silly rather than to actually evaluate what language a person should learn._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* required software: Visual Studio Code
1. Clone repository to a local repository.
2. Use VS code to read the code.
3. Open index.html to see the webpage in your default web browser.
* [gh-pages deployment](https://cat-denton.github.io/lang-suggester/)

## Known Bugs

* _Results are based only on answers to "favorite pet" and "astrological sign" questions._
